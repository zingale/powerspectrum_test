-- draw a diagram of the k-plane with the spherical shells superposed

   argue that when we bin, we need to use full shells, so the corners will
   not be included and if our zones are not cubic, we'll leave out some
   stuff too.

-- need to find the scaling at the end that allows us to sum the E(k)
   to get the correct energy (a la Parseval's theorem).  Something may
   be off.
